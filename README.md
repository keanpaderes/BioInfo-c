A CMSC128 assignment, a Simple Bioinformatics Library in programmed in C.

## Introduction
Bioinformatics is a interdisciplinary field that analyzes biological data using software tools. This mini-project aims to 
create a simple Bioinformatics function library in C Language.

## Instructions
- **Running with Interface** - I've included an interface to use the functions. In order to run the interface, compile it and you're good to go.
- **Using as a library** - Everything from the bioinfoc-lib.h is stand-alone. Just copy it to your project folder and import it.

## Functions
- **int getHammingDistance (char *str1, char *str)** - Given two strings str1 and str2 of same length (not 0 or negative!), it gives back an integer of the number of inversions per character need to transform str1 to str2 or vise-versa.
